# Robotic-Food-Transfer-System-3D-Model-

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a 3D design of a robotic arm system capable of transferring food packages from a manual or semi-automated warehouse to a fully automated one without human interaction. The design was created using Tinkercad, focusing on mechanical design and spatial simulation (without electronic components).

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Robotic Arm (joints and segments)
- Gripper (claw to pick up packages)
- Storage Container (automated warehouse section)
- Support Base
- Simulation Packages (food boxes)

## 🧠 Working Algorithm
1. Detect presence of package .
2. Move robotic arm to the pick-up location.
3. Grab the package using the gripper.
4. Rotate and position arm toward storage zone.
5. Drop the package in the storage bin.
6. Return to idle position and repeat.

## 📐 Robot Motion Zones

### ✅ Working Area
The space in which the robotic arm can **physically move and operate**.  
- Example: The circular or rectangular area around the base where the arm can **grab, lift, rotate**, and **place packages**.

### 🚫 Dead Area
Zones that are **out of reach** of the robotic arm — either:
- Beyond the maximum arm extension
- Below the base level
- Behind fixed obstacles
- Not within rotation range

These are parts where the robot **cannot interact** with objects.

### 🔄 Working Envelope
The **3D space** the robotic arm can cover, combining:
- **Horizontal reach** (left to right)
- **Vertical motion** (up and down)
- **Rotational limits**

It is usually represented as a **transparent rectangular prism** or **sweeping arc** around the robot arm.

> In this project, the working envelope is approximately:
> - Width (X): 20 cm  
> - Depth (Y): 15 cm  
> - Height (Z): 20 cm  
> - Rotation: 180°


## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Add electronics simulation using Tinkercad Circuits.
- Implement real-time object detection and path planning.
- Export to Fusion 360 for advanced mechanics.
